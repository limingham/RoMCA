# RoMCA
Robust Multi-reference Cell Annotation

![Uploading image.png…]()


Here, we propose RoMCA, a cell type annotation algorithm based on non-negative least squares (NNLS) that leverages the multiple reference samples. In our preliminary benchmark tests, RoMCA has demonstrated superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art cell type annotation algorithms, making it a valuable bioinformatics tool.
