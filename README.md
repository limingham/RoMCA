Here, we propose RoMCA, a cell type annotation algorithm based on non-negative least squares (NNLS) that leverages the multiple reference samples. In our preliminary benchmark tests, RoMCA has demonstrated superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art cell type annotation algorithms, making it a valuable bioinformatics tool.



|  | RoMCA  | SciBet | 
| :-------: | :------: | :-------: |
|   H1    |  85.1%   | 80.3%  | 
|  H2   |  93.2%   | 90.7% | 


Below is the confusion matrix of RoMCA's cell type annotation results on the H2 sample:
